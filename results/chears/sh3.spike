any chelsea fan must be upset scoring one goal against arsenal with nine men^xx
just shows how good is arsenal's defense that with even 9 men, chelsea still can't score another goal^xx
beating arsenal won't change mourihno's fortunes. he is still getting fired this season.^xx
#thescoreke #chears..stand buy for the coaches rough handshakes!might need security intervention^xx
our squad this season is so timid. we're leading 1-0 with 9-men arsenal, but still plays defensive! we need more goals! #chears^xx
arsenal  fans 👏👏👏^xx
alltså mina känslor för diego costa just nu. som den största mobbaren på skolgården. hans beteende hör inte hemma på fotbollsplanen #arsenal^xx
@chelseafc @premierleague i don't want 2nd chelsea goal just for one man i.e petr cech. welcome back legend !! #chears^xx
very good performance until it became 9 v 12. @arsenal^xx
now wait for #wengerout chants to start..or "u will be sacked in the morning".. trust me,it never works at @arsenal^xx
los fanaticos del arsenal deberían pensar q es mas culpa de su dt de mierda que del arbitro no?^xx
lessons from today's game: mike dean is shit. chelsea is shit. we weren't awful for being down men. but really chelsea and dean are shit.^xx
kasi can lah fans chelsea pun nak riak jugak kesian depa dah lama tak merasa^xx
el chelsea, con dos jugadores más, tocando y tocando en su campo a falta de 5 minutos. mou y su estilo de juego^xx
wtf two red cards for arsenal, jose would have somtin to say if it was rather on the flip side!^xx
@ashley87gaming you're a shit fan base lmao, all i can hear is arsenal fans^xx
@arsenalghanasc @arsenal am proud of our boyz even though we are down by 2 men and a goal. they have shown resilient^xx
if i get to uni to find one of my flat mates is a chelsea fan i'll burn their possessions^xx
arsenal down to 9 men and our fans are still the loudest at the bridge 👍^xx
#cfc can only beat a team with 9 men.....do you think two can get sent off against us tomorrow 😁^xx
delighted to see arsenal getting the same treatment we suffered against them! what goes around comes around! #afc #nufc^xx
the way the referee played today, it wont be any surprise if @chelseafc decided sub him off and bring on another #chelsea player.^xx
mike dean's wife would refuse to have sex with him tonight. rt if you agree! #chears^xx
@zamani_kilz one ghanian arsenal fan one kill himself for here^xx
9 men on the pitch and chelsea only 1-0 up. what a shit side. motm mike dean. #cfcvafc^xx
2 red cards and chelsea cannot score more than 1 goal? issokay^xx
watching the arsenal game from my phone (or at least the live tweets)^xx
hay que decirlo y lo cierto es que diego costa es el jugador más chelsea que ha tenido chelsea en la historia.^xx
diego costa is a disgrace to football #afc #coyg^xx
one thing chelsea are excellent at cheating. the best i've seen.^xx
@davidssonomann japp, men han hittar nog ett rött på en chelsea spelare i 95:e så det jämnar ut sig^xx
arsenal away fans! ❤^xx
i can't stand chelsea^xx
@fraudiesta who knew that mk's mum would be arsenal's number 11^xx
#cfcvafc all over the social media arsenal is gettin da sympathy vote,i give also mine 2red card..... waaah^xx
i seriously don't understand how anyone can support chelsea, bloody scum^xx
@obembesky mr arsenal lol^xx
@arsenal a team who win many more than they lose have a win percentage of 7% with mike dean in charge. think about that for a moment @fa^xx
anyone just see willian chillin in the background when josé was yelling 😎 #cfc^xx
you see what i mean. wenger should have taken cazorla off instead of coquelin...hard luck @arsenal #chears^xx
chelsea are fucking awful to watch. against 9 men or not. hope arsenal nick a point somehow.^xx
thank god i'm not having to hear arsenal fans whine at a certain local bar.^xx
chelsea iki opooo^xx
un chiffre un jour:3,durant toute sa carrière,mourinho n'a jamais perdu 3 matchs de suite #chears^xx
@tobjizzle chelsea^xx
we used to play this game when a "monkey" would stand in the middle of a circle and try to catch a passing ball thrown across. #chears^xx
mike dean man of the match for chelsea^xx
@christ_morray @arsenal pareil mais j'lâcherai un ptit "ya salam" avant^xx
poor arsenal, man 🙇^xx
'el terremoto del 85…en parís', escribe @panchogarfias en #arsenal^xx
@biosh14 j'essaye de compatir c'est vraiment compliqué de supporter arsenal^xx

@ianjamespoulter @diegocosta he's done nowt wrong. arsenal players are cheats^xx
arsenal looked like a side wanting a draw from the start.^xx
@rohanbawa4 chelsea have fans?^xx
can't complain at arsenal players today , we got robbed^xx
bring on flamini on 90mins, break costa's leg, slap mike dean, take a red card for the team, then drop kick mourinho, become a legend. #afc^xx
chelsea are a disgrace to the premier league^xx
j'aimerais bien qu'arsenal égalise à la dernière minute^xx
@piersmorgan chelsea´s defenders were so afraid of 9 players that they decide to practice some passes^xx
3 anos que o arsenal não faz um gol no chelsea kkkkk^xx
chelsea ils peuvent gagner la pl 3fois de suite bah sa restera tjrs un club de mort^xx
can we give the motm award to the ref and the linesman? utter joke of a game today. #afc #afcvcfc^xx
@kristianhageru1: chelsea-arsenal 88:08 legg merke til han i bakgrunn som ler av mourinho. #2premierleaks^xx
that ref might as well of put a chelsea shirt on 😳 no way costa should be on the pitch, 2 arsenal players sent off for less.^xx
: actually, chelsea sucks.^xx
pedro will probably end up being a good signing, but mike dean was the best signing for chelsea this summer.^xx
if chelsea can't score against 9 men, does that justify them as boring? #cfcvafc #chelsea #arsenal #bpl #coyg^xx
mainnya kaya' latihan padahal baru unggul 1 goal, sedangkan defisit gol chelsea masih minus. #kritis #gabisanyantai #heran^xx
ukichengwa tulia hahahah arsenal deeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaddddd!!!!!!!!!^xx
@samueljayc sorry, we didn't lose to chelsea, we lost to mike dean^xx
arsenal é como se fosse o internacional brasileiro 😂😂😂😂 monta um bom time,mais ganha porra nenhuma^xx
is that arsenal fans chanting loudly? if it is,👏👏👏^xx
chelsea está a ganhar, falta o bayern e o wolfsburg^xx
they could have had what 5 goals by now?,i mean the advantage is extraordinary on their account,disappointing from chelsea#chears^xx
away fans we salute you #arsenal^xx
#chears si on rejoue contre chelsea en ldc, je vais remonter à paris pour descendre diego costa. j'en peux plus, faut qu'il se pete un truc^xx
arsenal fans hapa local are taking pints like crazy,loooooll^xx
@tobjizzle arsenal^xx

#bbcfootball live text has shown all the pics of hands on costa, not a single one where he's puts hands on arsenal. what gives?^xx
arsenal lagi apes aja.^xx
sebab tu ade orang yang tak paham pedih tengok bola ni lagi kaw daripada gaduh dengan makwe..contoh macam game arsenal ni..spoil sebab reff^xx

lmao "@kneeyie: mike deak wey don follow spurs celebrate goal against arsenal before. make una dey speak english. mscheww"^xx
for football reasons, i wouldn't like any team to be  men down in any single day, very bad for #arsenal,^xx
first team in the pl to not score against chelsea this season.... #arsenal^xx
49 49 i say...  #arsenal^xx
le seum arsenal perd :/^xx
"off, off, off" cantaron los fans del arsenal tras la última falta de koscielny. el humor, ese último recurso.^xx
unfair for arsenal tbh, its 12 men versus 9 now...^xx
diego costa is perfect for chelsea both classless, boring and play fucking ugly football^xx
arsenal down to 9 men what the hell man😂😂😂^xx
come on arsenal !!!!!!!!^xx
chelsea had to gt a 12th player i.e d refree to beat d 9 players of arsenal........diego costa is a barbarian! #fact^xx
boring chelsea. 😪^xx
diego costa is one of the best idiot beings to ever live ⚽️ #chelsea"^xx
if after 2 red cards &amp; you still cannot score more than a goal after so much possession, then something is wrong with this team #cfc^xx
one goal against  9 men? ?  chelsea you are still useless!^xx
the @arsenal away fans are so so good!!!! pride!!!^xx
el chelsea no puede estar contento por esta victoria. lo que pintaba su mejor partido de premier hasta ahora acabó siendo más de lo mismo.^xx
hmm tknk ckp psl chelsea hmm^xx
hazard plus 99mil for bale, chelsea would still be the winner in that equation^xx
chelsea are actually scum^xx
arsenal can suck a dick^xx
tbh kosihelny could be off. bit of a nightmare from arsenal today. evan at 11-11 we have been on top.^xx
desvirtuado por las expulsiones el arsenal lleva 2 juegos sin ganar. mal momento.^xx
aww man.9 players vs 11 players.ref. mike dean is really brutal. #chears^xx
just effin attack @arsenal^xx
honestly as a chelsea fan, i agree with other on costa. he's a good striker but he has a dick for a personality^xx

#premierleague^xx
@arsenal is this the "mental response" that arsehole wenger always goes on about? two players sent off??? he has seriously lost the plot!!!^xx
with 2 red cards...chelsea still play like this?.....pathetic^xx
broke up with my girlfriend yesterday, but i think mike dean officiating arsenal was far worse than that.^xx
chelsea x arsenal é tipo vasco x fluminense, não importa a porra da fase. freguesia...^xx
after d robbery! "@makeupbymena: arsenal fans!! how market??😂😂😂😂"^xx
i feel so fucking bad for this arsenal team. because of that dirty move, this game was always one sided^xx

udah macam barca madrid aja, diputar terus sama chelsea hahaha^xx
bipolar sungguh fans arsenal. kata chelsea boring. bila bagi drama sikit, tak suka pulak. habis nak macam mana lagi setan!^xx
most chelsea fans are just glory hunters^xx
"@johncrossmirror: arsenal down to nine men. jose mourinho about to bring on mikel to shore the game up. i think he wants to win. a lot."^xx
el chelsea vuelve a ganar un partido, pero gracias a jugar contra 9. dan mucha pena^xx
i hope someone recorded the face and gestures mourhino just made #gif #cfc #cfclive #chears #ilovejose^xx

@georgerobbins10 @truegeordienufc you mean like he did against chelsea?^xx
@easynight1 lamentable cette arbitrage c'est toujours pour chelsea après on s'étonne que chelsea est critiquer^xx
the only thing that's vexing me now is i should have given chelsea straight win and increased my odds.^xx
@bbcsport i suppose.you asking mourinho after the game if there's still a campaign against chelsea is out of the question?? #bbcfootball^xx
2 red cards for arsenal, costa could have 4 of his own!^xx
everytime i watch arsenal after not watching them for agesssssss, they always lose like wtf is this.^xx
en el arsenal todo como siempre.ozil mal como siempre;alexis mal como siempre;jack lesionado como siempre.@afcbrit @dflatorre @wengerinho^xx
i can't remember the last time i saw any sporting fixture officiated so poorly #arsenal^xx
the fact the arsenal fans are singing louder when were loosing 1-0 and down to 9 men is just embarrassing for chelsea #worstfans^xx
i was thinking this chelsea side has improved but they still find it hard to play against a 9 man arsenal team *rethink*^xx
@craigfagan7 ridiculous mate. the ref is a joke. chelsea exciting team aren't they?!?!^xx
good news is chelsea is still shit, if we win our game tomorrow we will b 3 points above arsenal #mufc^xx
has pretty boy @_oliviergiroud_ ever tackled anyone or taken a fall for his team? @arsenal just asking! can't wait for the handshake after!^xx
the 1st time arsenal are losing and giroud is not to blame^xx
only thing left is a penalty for chelsea^xx
this is driving me mad! @_oliviergiroud_ is on minutes and hes standing with his hands on his hips. after midweek youd think hed try #afc^xx
@rubengalahad no mams, en serio?? pues si fue así, entonces lo entiendo. solo de esa forma podía el chelsea^xx
a trop penser à comment costa mérite la muerte. j'ai pas cité non plus le fait qu'arsenal est pas plus beau à voir jouer que chelsea^xx
@cesc4official what happened to you, when you were in arsenal you didn't dive #afc #chelsea^xx
@arsenal i'm patiently waiting for the moment ref mike dean will award a penalty to @chelseafc to crown his night's performance. #cfcvafc^xx
wow chelsea make playing against us look so difficult evens with the help of the ref...wanna get them second leg^xx
so chelsea has resorted to buying refs...^xx
@demxswarrior it's my love for arsenal!😂🙈❤️^xx
fan dari club lain semua bash chelsea . fan chelsea je bangga dgn kemenangan yg sngt noob ni^xx
3 points to mike dean. motm #chears^xx
headlines: chelsea regain their winning form

reality: chelsea play another poor game and were handed a win at home.^xx
ffs they're 9. we should be attacking more. #cfc^xx
how much did chelsea pay mile dean?^xx
arsenal fans crying because the sending offs have 'changed the game' 

karma, that!

#nufc^xx
@truckerpaddy its typical arsenal but mentally weak in the big games it's so frustrating^xx
haih sedih tengok arsenal tapi sedih lagi tengok chelsea dah 2 orang kena kad merah pun tak boleh sumbat gol lagi ha ha ha!^xx
chelsea 2-0^xx
chelsea vs arsenal is a controversial match^xx
take note how the ox didnt roll around on the floor when costa hit out at him, this is why chelsea will never be remembered as a good team^xx
if it was an 11 vs 11 game for 90 mins, @arsenal would have thoroughly wreck the hell out of mourinho and his team of useless players^xx
😂😂😂"@mtupombe: arsenal kikombe wata beba peke yake niya chai^xx

i guess the gods decreed it long b4 football was born: a blind mou will always win four-eyed wenger. story of immutability #chears #cfcvafc^xx
bruh if chelsea really come around and win this epl i'd probably just start supporting leeds united.^xx
i'm proud of my arsenal... #coyg^xx
the most painful thing is at best....arsenal will get a draw at the emirates in similar fixture.^xx

uno madrugando para ver al chelsea y no ponen a falcao^xx
@davincimannen ja, i dag var han uspiselig. kanskje på tide at chelsea setter skapet på plass mtp oppførsel?^xx
if that's true, then (a lot of) you chelsea fans are scum, sha. you're the same ones who pushed a black man off a train, yes?^xx
combined with the fact that the ridiculous english mentality is that diving is the only form of cheating. #chears #bplonnbc^xx
nose si es peor o mejor. pero el juego del chelsea no es la locura que identifica a la premier.^xx
typical. #arsenal never beats chelsea under mourinho. some things never change. #chears^xx
gg chelsea^xx
@tobjizzle arsenal^xx
.@alanschrader it's like fighting arsenal for 4th doesn't excite them or something.^xx
losing to chelsea when they've had their worst start in 30 years is the most arsenal thing ever.^xx
that shit called arsenal...
wenger; expert in failure
not watching though...^xx
what a fucking tosser diego costa is #chears^xx

ああ… #arsenal #arsenaljp^xx
el árbitro y sus errores influye en el resultado, pero no se puede hablar de robo al arsenal.^xx
with 9 against 11 chelsea can't get enough chance to add more goals^xx
estaba claro que si el chelsea iba a ganar un partido, sería al arsenal.^xx
