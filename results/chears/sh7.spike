i fucking hate chelsea so much scum of the earth^xx
other than maybe the positioning for the goal, koscielny has really shown why he should be arsenal capt, throwing himself in front of it all^xx

@arsenal @calumchambers95 this ref absolutely sucks^xx
i doubt very much that mourinho is pleased with #cfc's showing so far. despite an extra man, #arsenal still easily slicing through defense.^xx
wish coquelin was still on. feel hes the only player who would be able to wind up costa enough to get him sent off. #arsenal^xx
@guinnessvip chelsea wil score in 79min^xx
@gunnerjane  i feel arsenal will get a chance, let's hope they take it. can't stand #chelseascum winning.^xx
@hazard__fan coming from a chelsea fan that's rich, scummiest club going^xx

costa is the main reason why chelsea is at the bottom^xx
1-0 up against 10 men puts on a cdm the chelsea way 😴^xx
someone told me once that hitler was a chelsea fan. never believed til today.^xx
chelsea consistently making a lot out of a little when it comes to challenges #chears #premierleague^xx

all arsenal fans just keep quiet here.^xx
carton jaune pour #chambers 
#chelsea 1  -  0  #arsenal (72')

parece que só há cartões para o arsenal^xx
chelsea football club 👎👎👎👎👎 #costa #disgrace^xx

pretty poor effort that the chelsea v arsenal game isn't on the big screen @bristolsportsbg @bcfctweets @bristol_sport^xx
arsenal fans and nxonxo are so pressed bruh! 😂^xx
to think arsenal and chelsea fans troll united fans over memphis (3 goals 1 assist so far), when they have alexis and hazard counting sheep.^xx
instead of y'all to be against chelsea, y'all should be praying that someone stops city^xx
chelsea players are a bunch of actresses^xx
chelsea are really poor tho^xx
why am i still watching this match though?!! more likely that chelsea would add a goal than arsenal equalising. #cfcvafc^xx
"@tobianoh007: cech has taught arsenal the bus parking technique"^xx
we love you arsenal we do, oh arsenal we love you! #afc^xx
not only cheats but actors as well those cfc players, lousy yellow#afc^xx
i pity chelsea fans. for they have to support a team that plays like this.^xx
@tjheaps play good football the right way, pretty simple stuff. cant expect that from boring boring chelsea. garbage franchise.^xx
mike dean loves a chelsea free kick^xx
so no be only chelsea sabi pack bus....^xx
walcott should play just off giroud, get after any flick ons. at least arsenal will have a target man up top and can still use pace #chears^xx
chelsea have made of living out of having the referee as the 12th man. small club with money and a load of cheating scumbags^xx
come on #arsenal dust yourself up and get on with it. #chears #cfcvafc^xx
cazorla and ramsey shouldn't be in this arsenal team^xx
when i was a small kid saturday mornings were for cartoons, now they're for premier league football #chelsea^xx
costa is playing shit &amp; he's on a yellow card...just take him off please! #cfc^xx
not sure what i was thinking with over 2.5 goals in arsenal v chelsea boring boring coupon burnt fingers crossed for others^xx

→ chelseafc a half-chance for arsenal as neither zouma or cahill get to a dropping ball but sanchez can't get a shot away. #cfclive^xx
arsenal have already lost start two footing some players give the fans something to cheer up^xx
it's a shame that the ref has ruined this game, arsenal really hadn't done anything wrong.^xx
toho #diegocosta snad vypískávají i vlastní fans. to je vážně bezcharakterní odpad. #chelsea #arsenal #premierleague^xx
come on arsenal^xx
arema wes menang🙌 saiki gari arsenal🙏😘^xx
@boltstar yeh there's no need for his behaviour. chelsea were all over arsenal prior to that^xx
→ chelseafc hazard turns sharply and goes at arsenal. his low shot is wide but that was good from the player of the year.  #cfclive^xx
#cfc fans chanting diego are as much a disgrace as the player himself. cheating scumbag.^xx
@sergio__alacant el chelsea me la suda^xx
giroud and ox to come on for arsenal^xx
@niallofficial hi niall can we trash chelsea together?^xx

arsenal fans will always have their excuse after loosing to us^xx
@fa seriously consider dropping mike dean!  or drop him for arsenal games clearly for years he's had something against arsenal!!  #manup^xx
positivity: giroud and ox to come on. have a go arsenal. #chears^xx
chelsea fans anonymous even when they're winning^xx
what was god thinking when he created wasps, spiders and chelsea^xx
if you have chambers playing at cdm, then your team is simply not good enough. there are bigger problems than costa @arsenal^xx
arsenal tak power lah sebab tak boleh kalah kan chelsea o^xx
mau jadi banci ? cry baby ma bastard ? yuk gabung d chelsea shemale club #cfc^xx
should koscielny not have held the line and make zouma offside?” you need organisation for that! arsenal aren't on sp.

#tizxonet☀^xx
i hope arsenal get something from this game.^xx
ref is overly keen on booking our players. i see nothing in this but chelsea boring passes, we gain the ball back the ref blows for any foul^xx
mike deane is awful that was a good challenge.  is he a chelsea fan @btsportfootball^xx
calum chambers has a yellow, guess diego costa will be after him too #chears^xx
a goal from arsenal now would take this game to new heights of footy ecstasy.^xx
arsenal playing with 10 men...shocking...^xx
let me tell you who's not a cunt at chelsea, eva ca... oh wait that makes it all of them cunts^xx

nice zouma. nice. "@panditfootball: zouma! umpan dari fabregas melalui tendangan bebas. chelsea 1-0 arsenal"^xx
chelsea lead ke doh,fuck ah^xx
my goodness but chelsea are a dirty bunch of crooks #cfcvafc^xx
one of biggest mysteries in football - what does steve bould actually do? certainly doesn't coach arsenal how to defend set pieces^xx
i don't know what's worse arsenal loosing or listening to michael owen commentate on it^xx
@micagonz4lez quién metió el gol del chelsea ?^xx
sidenote, havent heard the chelsea 'fans' at all^xx
@arsenal @calumchambers95 thts a nice tackle f**k^xx
chelsea fans are rent boys, diego costa is a cunt, and gabriel is a dumbass^xx
i'm guessing now is a bad time to support chelsea....^xx
@jaydnmufc  but for real it looks like the refs and the media just don't like arsenal^xx
players like diego costa are the reason why we hate chelsea...

#arsenal #chevsars^xx
if you look very closely you can just about see mike deans chelsea shirt poke out from beneath is own shirt.^xx

@cesarf_1982 el patron ha pasado casi todo el partido pidiendo una formacion con 2 delateros para chelsea, seria bien la dupla falcao/costa^xx
arsenal won't challenge for the league^xx
i bet arsenal get a 88th minute equaliser or something^xx
chelsea need another goal fast.^xx
at this point, i'd take a draw #chears #bpl^xx
hope this game end up draw, but if chelsea win this is good for us, right?^xx
