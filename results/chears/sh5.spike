c simple chelsea je déteste et arsenal j'suis pas fan^xx
chelski have become mourinho's real madrid, cheating, diving, thugs. its amusing that is has cost arsenal, but football is fucked!^xx
in all fairness, costa should have seen red. gabriel's red justified. not smart enough taking on costa. a big blow to arsenal.^xx
lol... a man down and now chambers in defence against chelsea?^xx
hopefully mike dean has seen the incident at h/t and has costa's card marked for the 2nd half. i doubt it though. it's mike dean. #afc^xx
fuck me no defensive midfielder now wow easy pickings for chelsea now^xx
is this what chelsea has been reduced to or what football has been reduced to? #chears^xx
rt bharianmy: epl: tiada penalti untuk chelsea sekalipun hazard dikasari gabriel di dalam kawasan penalti. minit ke-34.^xx
arsenal sub: coquelin off - chambers on.^xx
if chelsea don't win this game hahaah their a joke^xx
wasit dah kasih hadiah nih buat chelsea utk menang, kalau nggak menang juga, yaelah bro ....^xx
je suis ni pour arsenal ni pour chelsea ... mais costa faut arrêter .^xx
@btsportfootball do chelsea fans not cringe when they see costa behaving like that?^xx
chelsea and their warped sense of ethics. completely distorted.^xx
j'ai beau aimer chelsea, costa c'est le roi des cons sur les terrains ma parole. bref en deuxième mi-temps à 11vs10 on doit en mettre 2^xx
@ahmadmadani97 gabriel wrestled hazard and chelsea were denied a penalty way earlier in the game :')^xx
no matter what the score is at the end chelsea are shittt #capitalshit^xx
jako kibic united liczyłem na remis, ale teraz mam nadzieję, że arsenal ich rozkurwi w 10.^xx
if i'm a chelsea fan, i'd be happy with what costa did and even tag him as my hero.. but i'm not his fan and i wish he get red card too^xx
@ramzzy_ eh.... watu wa arsenal wake ends but hii ya leo imeshangaza.^xx
how can you support chelsea^xx
ht: chelsea 0-0 arsenal 
the gunners are down by one man following the row between costa and gabriel.^xx
what's the role of the lines man if he didn't see that sh*t?...  damn!  it's gonna be a long 2nd half. come on arsenal #afc^xx
"@nuel1transport: cry me a river arsenal fans" 😣😣^xx
@arsenal @diegocosta is a bloody wanker! he play's like a sissy. diego deserved that red card!^xx
#chears costa should be disciplined just like luis suarez^xx
i didnt know that my hate for chelsea would ever increase but it has, all because of two words "diego costa". #cfcvafc^xx
seeing the difference between #chears and #engfij players makes football look like a joke. #babycosta^xx
second half, leggo #cfc^xx
chambers, oh dear #arsenal^xx
the only way to truly stick it to the red, mourinho, and the cunts in blue will be to beat them with ten men. #chears #cfcvafc^xx
gabriel for arsenal looks like he could eat  an apple through a letterbox with those teeth. #chelsea #arsenal^xx
chelsea yen şu arsenali be 215 lira gelicek^xx
costa's a prick. #chears^xx
chambers in for coq? r u just serious rite now? #chears^xx

@joe_weller_ chelsea is ruining football...^xx
@hazardben10 @arsenal die^xx
costa. not not not a gentleman...should have been sent off too. coming from a chelsea fan.^xx

@audsldn chelsea fan......... you probably got a poster of giroud in ur room^xx
@officialmgh arsenal fans act like babies once again^xx
really hope arsenal win^xx
arsenal should send gabriel back out for the 2nd half and claim it was a 'fake' red card. #jose'sworld^xx
coquelin off? that's a chelsea win then^xx
@dapo_ki drama everywhere he goes, arsenal still dey sha^xx
callum chambers on, coquelin off.. arsenal down to 10.. delicious^xx

arsenal are too nicey nicey. we need a couple of proper nasty bastards^xx
i really rate coq, quality player and a big loss for arsenal buttttt a win for chelsea^xx
wanted arsenal to win because mourinho's face would have been priceless but now i hope costa scores an 87th minute winner^xx
arsenal sub: chambers on for coquelin.^xx
watchin #arsenal vs #chelsea, diego costa should be suspended by the league. #unsportsmanlike, #poorexample, #cheater, #nocharacter^xx
arsenal will win the appeal on the 3 match ban 100%^xx
: replays show it was gabriel kicking backwards into diego costa that earned the arsenal defender his straight red card. #cfclive"^xx
se chelsea x arsenal fosse um "clássico-clássico", o goleiro reserva do arsenal já tava dando voadora no diego costa^xx
kene kad merah. hahahaa sabar fans arsenal^xx

@kelcey_wallace typical chelsea fan ;-)^xx

chambers is on for arsenal for the start of this second half - coquelin is the player withdrawn. #cfclive^xx
@novelaspalo padahal chelsea diuntungin, pe wkwk^xx
2nd half is under way. change for arsenal. coquelin goes off and chambers comes on. 0-0 #chears^xx
hey mike dean, go &amp; play golf you fuckin asshole... #chears^xx
gabriel is a very old school "dirty" arsenal type of defender. i kind of like it... shame about the red card though.^xx
coquelin big loss.. this is chelsea's to take now^xx
hotng2 soccer-terry left out by mourinho for the first time john terry's disrupted start to the season continued on saturday when chelsea m…^xx

chelsea 0x0 arsenal^xx
i vividly remember when mike dean cerebrated spur goal against arsenal. his red card for gabriel is not a surprise^xx
j'ai déja cassé des chevilles pour moins que ça moi #chears^xx
@ar53n4l_fc mike dean couldn't make his hate for arsenal any more clearer^xx
right, let's make this (so much) better performance produce some goals, chelsea!^xx
why do none of our players surround the ref like chelsea players? they just make it easy for him to make a decision, no pressure at all.^xx
costa c'est un fils de ....#chears^xx
this match is so ugh. 0-0 at the half, @arsenal down to 10 men, and michael owen commentating. #chears^xx

according to chelsea idiots being an total dick is smart. carry on defending him and alienate your club from rest of football world.^xx
let's bully chambers chelsea.^xx
chelsea is just becoming more pathetic. they should even say goodbye to their title.^xx
off course this will be spun by the media as 'chelsea's will to win'^xx
have arsenal gone three at the back?^xx
#chears diego costa should be taken off, he's walking on a tight rope now^xx

diego costa is a disgrace #chears^xx
chelsea c'est mon équipe mais diego costa je le supporte pas, je l'ai jamais supporté même quand il claquait but sur but ✋🏾^xx
imagine being an actual chelsea fan and thinking your club has a history and isn't run in blood money you scumbags^xx
mike dean isn't gonna penalize any chelsea player today cos he's a blue. arsenal players should get used to this, and play their game.^xx
fuck the ref, fuck chelsea, fuck mourinho, fuck diego costa you dirty piece of fucking shit!^xx
i just wanna see chelsea in the relegation zone 😭^xx
200x0 chelsea^xx
gabriel didn't fall into shit! 
mike dean fell for the bs as a shambolic epic fail of a ref he is.
shoutout to the blind linesman too! #afc^xx
arsenal atsın bir tane^xx
@dw_whittaker didn't really see what happened, all the chelsea accounts i follow say costa lucky to stay on himself!^xx
hadde vært veldig gøy med 0-0 eller 0-1 nå, men det blir vel chelsea-seier. #2pl^xx
if i was gabriel i will take that red card from his hand and raise it up also against mike dean and costa. the 3 of us must leave #chears^xx
world now : that's why i hate chelsea.
me : that's why i love chelsea.
#cfcvafc  #costa^xx

burde vært 2 røde? joda, men det røde til arsenal ville jo ikke kommet om costa fikk rødt først..^xx

that was a matured behaviour from kociently,a childish behaviour from costa,and a bad call from referee  akinson #chelsea 0 0 arsenal^xx
another chelsea game and yet another costa anger outburst! something needs to be done before someone gets seriously hurt #cfcvafc @bbcmotd^xx
mourinho

@arsenal you can have gabriel back if we get the penalty what we should've had against hazard! #cfcvafc^xx
if arsenal were every near as cynical as chelsea, they'd spend this whole 2nd half trying to get costa sent off.^xx
chelsea will win now^xx
don't remember seeing mike dean on chelsea's list of summer signings.^xx
love or hate it. mission accomplished diego.#cfc #thescoreke^xx
diego costa is proper scum, only one team in the league for him and that's chelsea. shit club!^xx

@jperrycomposer does he happen to do some part time work for chelsea fc?^xx
chambers. brilliant change...for chelsea!^xx
they had to sacrifice coquelin as well goodbye arsenal^xx
#cfcvafc #arsenal need a redemption for this^xx
diego costa probably spits at refugees. he's a superb fit for chelsea.^xx
lol everyone that is not a chelsea fan hates diego costa^xx
one thing i don't understand is why didn't arsenal surround the ref when costa pushed koscienly!?^xx
@samueljayc ,its easy 4 d official 2 spot an ars offense but seem its difficult 4 them 2 see that of chelsea's!! pathetic^xx
wow arsenal without coquelin^xx
how is diego costa still on the pitch? not once, twice
would rather costa concentrate on the technical part of his game
chelsea - arsenal^xx
ah, y otra decisión arbitral que beneficia al chelsea de mou. y ya van...^xx
if i was a chelsea fan i'd be totally embarrassed to have a player like diego costa anywhere near my team^xx
why am i not surprised to see chelsea come down to such tactics to stop their bad run? #chears^xx
comienza el segundo tiempo . chelsea 0-0 arsenal^xx

"@fidelwandago: diego costa has perfected that skill before and its not a surprise he repeated it today and it worked. #cfcvafc #chears" lol^xx
if arsenal and chelsea faced each other in the ucl final, the internet would break^xx
overriding motion after seeing all that stuff at the end of the #chelsea #arsenal 1st half... embarrassment. kids behave better.^xx

even if chelsea win it is a fake result. a draw will serve justice!^xx
@damianomantica: ridicola l'espulsione al difensore dell'#arsenal vista la sola ammonizione al bambino #diegocosta. @skysport #premierleague^xx

london derbies match 

#chelsea เอาหน่อย^xx
fuck chelsea as a staff, record label and as a motherfucking crew.^xx
mike dean should have been booked. he has been a bigger cunt. #chears^xx
arsenal lack characters. the old guys like vierra and pires would've dealt with costa.^xx
rt if you hate the chelsea rent boy's. #afc^xx
@arsenal koscielny could have complained to the ref but he showed maturity costa,was complaining to the refree like he was a little child.^xx
if the team needs some factor to unite nothing can be better than that one!! #chears^xx
@footysupertips do u reckon chelsea -1 handicap is a good idea^xx
chelsea and costa is a match made in heaven.^xx
@asroridr @ivhansandya enggak ah, setia sm chelsea.^xx
i pray chelsea don't come out of this with 3 points. would be comedy^xx
gbam "@booombguy: gabriel was unprofessional for few minutes.. costa has been unprofessional since he joined chelsea"^xx
gotta say, this free stream i'm watching for the game is absolute quality. #chears^xx
finally, @arsenal  got a warrior: #gabriel 
#cfcvafc^xx
the fa should give that chelsea asshole an even longer ban^xx
arsenal should get a two, three nil nw worse like hw coquelan come off^xx
park the bus, take a point home. that's all @arsenal^xx
mike dean just won the game for chelsea^xx
chelsea - arsenal que me tan a falcao :d^xx
mike dean berated for gabriel/costa handling - that's fair - but assistants have offered no support by missing 3 red card shouts. #chears^xx
we still winning this game forget about the red card,i believe in my team #afc^xx
come on chelsea!^xx
@sergezarka and smart😂 come on chelsea^xx
sasa hata hadi nimeanza kusupport arsenal.....fucking rent boys!!!^xx
if we were a classless team like chelsea, kos would have stayed on the floor rolling around holding his face and got costa sent off^xx
début de la deuxième mi temps, pour rappel #arsenal joue avec 10 après l’expulsion de #gabriel 
#chears #bpl^xx
0 dan 2 girdim hadi olm arsenal 10 kişi destan yaz be kadıköy destanı gibi^xx
i fucking hate costa. disgrace to the game. fuck him and fuck chelsea!^xx
the fact that chelsea fans idolise that cunt of a player sums them up^xx
wait. so coquelin injured? no mertesacker. no gabriel for next week. why can't city play arsenal next week?😫^xx
@tgriff716 better than any striker for sure... i think arsenal has other players that matchup with him^xx
arsenal...chambers por coquelin... vamos gunners!!!^xx
#premierxespn qué tibio y pobre análisis, como costa está acostumbrado a ensuciar el fútbol entonces la culpa es del defensa del arsenal.^xx
mike dean stopped us winning a league title. he's shite not anti-arsenal^xx
o arsenal tem de ganhar ❤^xx
i say all arsenal fans group together and pay someone to break costas legs and jaw?^xx
well played chelsea 👏🏻 lets see if u can score with them 10 man. lol^xx
lol coquelin off, chelsea have won goodbye^xx
chelsea 0-0 arsenal^xx

the rant arsenal fans are showing costa will all be history if chelsea win that game....^xx
leggo arsenal. you can do it^xx
second half is underway. come on chelsea!^xx
watching diego #costa makes me understand how none #lfc fans felt about #suarez a lot of the time #chears^xx
@arsenal it's high time for video referral be used.it's killing the football without it.^xx
diego costa should be very careful. #cfc #cfcvafc^xx

@ramli_3rdson chelsea v arsenal more important lol^xx
allez arsenal faut tenir le nul^xx
arsenal
2 games = 2 red cards

@rnrfootball #chears thats one of the worst five minutes of handbags ive ever witnessed a disgrace to football^xx
mike dean and chelsea fc must be investigated for match-fixing.^xx
come on chelsea^xx
can’t imagine if vieira still play for arsenal^xx

already got a red card might as well take the l and fill costas face in. #afc^xx
chambers is coming on. shoot me now...wile hard..till it hurts . #chears^xx

a very stupid player. motherf**cking son of a bitch. #diegocosta #cfc^xx
come on arsenal^xx
costa is lucky today 🙏🙏 #cfc^xx
wouldn't mind to see chambers get a lifetime ban for breaking costas legs. #afc^xx

when your dad supports chelsea and your boyfriend supports arsenal and your just sitting in the middle of them like 😁🔫^xx
refs really need to give uninfluenced decisions. costa acting as #chelseababy #zlatan #bpl #chears^xx
@ingsinho arsenal twitter is gonna make all your tweets bang 😂^xx
@estevasexta @chelseafc @arsenal la jugada es anterior, no se ve cuando konciesly tira a costa.. costa lamentable imagen^xx
that's how mourinho &amp; his teams at football .... keep together &amp; try &amp; get summit from the game boys #afc^xx

@__arsenalnews_ @arsenal         call a spade a spade. we all know how costa plays. disappointed by gabriel.w'll lose against chelsea again.^xx
10 men my 6 year old is hopeful. i hope the emotional drive takes us through #arsenal^xx

babak kedua sudah mulai! apa yang akan terjadi? chelsea unggul jumlah pemain setelah bek gabriel dikartu merah wasit mike dean. #chears^xx

#emotionally
#confidentially
#mantoman
#cfc #cfclive^xx

when u fight with a thug, the thug will drag u down to his level, and win you with experience.... #chelseafc @arsenal^xx

i think gabs is well on the way to becoming my favourite arsenal player! that kind of attitude has been missing for such a long time...^xx
well done ref. thanks for giving the game to chelsea. why you didn't give costa a red card himself is beyond me.^xx
oque mais me irrita é que a torcida do chelsea ama tudo isso que o diego faz,jogador nojento,time nojento^xx
diego costa's inner devil seem to be his default playing personality. a ticking time bomb. liability. #chears^xx
¡comienza el segundo tiempo en stamford bridge! 

chelsea 0-0 arsenal 

#bpl^xx
let's b crious, he did not worth d card"@stone_of_help4: @chelseafc costa got his game spot on. arsenal fans already have an excuse"^xx
let arsenal just try and score then it did be pretty easy to have the demon sent off.^xx
chambers no coquelin pra recompor a zaga do arsenal. já diego costa segue no jogo.^xx
mike dean should stop officiating any match involving arsenal #chears^xx
any other team i'd feel sorry for. ridiculous decisions, but the immatureness of arsenal fans is hilarious...^xx
hoping chelsea score an own goal and arsenal hold on for the win. come on football gods!^xx
diego costa is a scum bag! @arsenal #cfcvafc^xx
with coquelin injured and @arsenal reduced to 10 men, it will be a miracle if the match ends in a draw.
#cfcvafc^xx
mike dean is the new howard webb. but this time, he's chelsea 12 man on the field^xx
pffff, je suis vraiment dégoûté en voyant les ralentis #chears^xx

@guyroutledge1: if you were a fan of any other club, you would absolutely hate costa! #cfc^xx
if i was an arsenal player, i'd have chinned costa in the tunnel to avoid a red card, bloke needs a leg broken^xx
@baronvondiego or your team could stop being dirty. it wouldn’t be necessary for someone to be bigger man if #cfc wasn’t always doing dirt.^xx
come on chelsea. 👌🏽^xx

is there anything more scum than chelsea?^xx
#chears 0-0 46' • fuori #coquelin, dentro #chambers •^xx
right then. the beginning of the downfall of arsenal in tonight’s match. all because of costa’s (pre-barcelona) suarez-like tricks. hate it.^xx
ozil has to come off for chambers their. you need speed to counter chelsea now and that's not ozil's game. wasted player now..^xx
will be absolutely amazed if #arsenal get anything out of this now. ref has changed the whole dynamic of this game.^xx
so hope arsenal go on and beat them now^xx
i don't want to watch 1 min more of this game ! ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous ! #chelsea you cheats ! come to the #emirates now vll see !^xx
arsenal is in real trouble now. don't see them holding on now. #chears^xx
city gonna be 8 points clear of arsenal then. nice.^xx

"@luis325i jo jo vaya comentario. si eres del chelsea debes ser party del 1% y si no , es comprensible." basta ver como juegan y en q pos va^xx
unless he's really injured. coquelin off is suicide.

chambers on doesn't fill me with confidence either.
#afcvcfc #arsenal^xx
listen god will punish costa. the presence of his karma shall arrive &amp; arsenal shall overcome^xx
"sub chambers replaces coquelin for @arsenal. we're back under way - chelsea 0-0 arsenal #chears"^xx
vamos arsenal!!! como seamos capaces de ganar aún con esta puta mierda de arbitraje.., les daremos bien por el culo! #comeonyougunners #coyg^xx
uno de mis más grandes sueños es ver un partido del #cfc en vivo. 😍 #foreverblue 💙^xx
@pandradeespn torço pelo chelsea, mas essas atitudes de diego costa são condenáveis. ele tem que jogar mais bola e parar de sÓ brigar.^xx
#chears diago costa is a prick. may he break a knee before the weekend ends. #cfcvafc #ssfootball^xx
to be fair, both sides are lucky in the first half, chelsea's lucky not to have costa off and arsenal lucky to concede a pen^xx
@arsenal fuck off home!^xx
the fact that you removed coq for chambers, you have lost. 

bye @arsenal^xx
watu wa arsenal, vungeni huyo costa kaa luke shaw^xx

coquelin injured now too. the fitness system in our team needs to be examined urgently. it's a fucking joke. #afc #arsenal^xx
costa should be playing rugby or american football so he can freely grab,  slap and punch #chears #che #premierleague^xx
