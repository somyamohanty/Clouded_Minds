gignac tak berfungsi langsung utk france __^in
les ukrainiens doivent cogiter aux vestiaires, ils ont forcément en tête le fameux match au stade de france il y a 2 ans #slourk #lt^fr
ross barkley is @england's best midfielder. #baller ⚽️🔥^en
#england look good until sterling gets on the ball 45 million ur having a laugh^en
can guess both sets of fans at wembley tonight are so overwhelmingly emotional. 
#france #paris #wembly^en
vous n'avez pas anéantie la france, non, vous l'avez unis.^fr
huge show of respect for england in their game vs france today. #biggerthanfootball^en
england are finally playing footy^en
raheem sterling is absolutely terrible 🙄 #engvsfra^en
a third of the @england side is made up of @spursofficial players, while the @equipedefrance keeper is my man hugo lloris. so many feelings.^en
never thought england would play this well^en
uh oh. giants re-sign nicks. beckham, nicks, randle. see you february new england. 😂^en
roy you need some glasses mate, i don't know what you see in sterling. 💩 #engfra^en
just watched the build up and anthems ahead of england vs france and there’s something in my eye^en
me and my housemate have started a mexican wave in our lounge 😴 #engvfra^en
if england go beyond group stage in euro 2016 it will be a great achievement^en
england have so many average left backs 👋🏼^en
vive la france!^fr
la france doit rester soudée et forte, ce n'est pas un attentat qui nous détruira. 
#prayforparis^fr
@tv2wikestad @reporterlars beklager, ja, mexico. også beskrevet i boka fra vm i 1986.^no
#angfra ça fait du bien d' entendre une belle marseillaise et une minute de silence bien respectées. je suis bête c' était pas en france...^fr
en vrai les paroles de la marseillaise sont grave violentes mdr c'est abusé. c'est parfait en ce moment en france !!^fr
@cahiersdufoot ca manque clairement d'un evra vs terry #engfra^fr
watching ben arfa play for france is like a massive 2 fingers in alan pardews smug chops #happyfuckingdays^en
@mathilde_klara  la france restera le pays le plus exposé aux attentats, à cause de notre diplomatie et de nos opérations extérieures.^fr
je suis fière de mon pays, la patrie des droits de l'homme, la france des lumières, 8/^fr
the surrounding countries of france know they gotta step in because obama is too much of a bitch to take action^en
just as one football crowd unites in london for #engvfra , another is evacuated in #hannover.^en
ross barkley is an england regular, and they wonder why nobody gives a shit about watching them.^en
wish those touchline ads said "tonights match sponsored by gitanes, gauloise, charles aznavour &amp; smelly cheese. up yours vauxhall" #engvfra^en
men jeg skal nok være positiv fra 2. halvleg. bolden er rund. vi laver en united mod bayern^da
@bilal_ali1 @aliladiere welbeck for england is actually very good, 6 goals in 5 games in qualifying. same goes for wilshere too, i think 6^en
the stupidity of movement by the england players is incredible. no thought about availability just ambling into pointless formation #engvfra^en
