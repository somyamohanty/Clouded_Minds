england are defending better because of dier and attacking better because of alli. what does that tell you #spurs  #thfc^en
glad england are taking their chances tonight but it doesn't seem right beating france in the circumstances^en
great goal that! the change to high pressure to win the ball back and then go on to score with a decent volley! #engvfra^en
england should take their foot off the pedal now, these shell shocked french players could do without a hiding!^en
england red hot^en
i actually feel bad for france losing^en
