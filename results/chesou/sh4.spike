chelsea il gagnerait même pas une deuxième division de district dans la marne^fr
great call ref ... falcao was on his way down looking for that penalty #cfc^en
falcao's hair makes him look a bit like tevez. chelsea wishes he could score like him tho^en
that's three penalties that should  have been awarded. #cfc #southampton^en
blatant penalty denied by the ref. yet again. booked falcao for diving? ffs!! #cfc^en
falcao, absent for most of the game, just got attention for a yellow card. #fail #cfc^en
who 's this guy wearing chelsea shirt no. 9 falcao?...must be an imposter!!!^en
er vi enige om, at chelsea - hjemme - kun er med i kampen, fordi willian har lavet et uvirkeligt mål? #krise #chesou #bpl^da

i wouldn't like to be a chelsea fan right now. very frustrating^en
chelsea "aparentemente" juega mejor sin dc, esta temporada fàbregas brilla de ausencia y hazard siempre es titular, el problema es eva 😂^es
radamel fall-cao!? what was that?! #cfclive #chesou^en
quinn mate what replay are you watching there he definitely dived! #saintsfc^en
falcao was already vertical before the keeper touched him. it's a dive. it's a booking. it's another reason chelsea are an embarrassment^en
when did niall quinn become a chelsea fan?^en

saints mean business against chelsea.^en
i apologize on the ref on chelsea side tweet, this ref is terrible. how was that a dive?^en
referee madley really is mad at the thought of anything being a penalty today for both chelsea &amp; southampton.^en

premier league referees are a joke. 3 penaltys not given. 1 for us, 2 for soton. #cfc^en
it's okay chelsea, it's not you, it's the ref^en
i'd say that's a chelsea penalty. definitely not a booking for falcao anuway. ref is a hopeless case.^en
mourinho is a clown aswear #cfc^en
less of a pen than the southampton shouts. probably still a pen though.^en
is this nial quinn a chelsea fan? that was a bloody stone wall dive!^en
typical chelsea fans. boo mane for diving and cheer ref for booking.

falcao gets booked for diving, chelsea boo the ref and say it's a pen^en
@nteoniro lmao why? i have to write about it and i know how chelsea's match will end^en

sergio aguero scores 5 goal vs southampton wonder if he would play in the isl for @thejohnabraham team #nufc #letsfootball^en
lee dixon is clown. he is adamant that was a peno. when its clearly a dive. #chesou^en
why are southampton chipping the ball when they're more dangerous by simply running past iva and shooting?^en
well we know *that* one will feature on match of the day. #chelseamanbooked #saintsfc^en
omg that was 100% penalty, chelsea are robbed ffs^en
un. fucking. believable. why can't chelsea catch a break this season...^en
someone seriously needs to take chelsea and mourinho out of football, nothing good comes from either^en

how was that a dive for falcao? #cfc^en
remember when chelsea fans got sold dream that mourinho would turn falcao into falcao again😅✋🏻^en
falcao is falling before the goalkeeper gets near his. boooked for diving, good decision #cfc #saints^en
je mag toch hopen dat bondschoach blind met beide ogen open naar #chesou kijkt &amp; eindelijk klasse @virgilvdijk ziet^nl
chelsea's cheating is so bad they dive even before certain contact. astounding.^en
pemain chelsea ni kuat berlakon sial, dengan costa, dengan oscar semua boleh berlakon. material player chelsea, drama king.^in
loool diving ? great ! fuck uou chelsea 😝^en
solo #arshavin ebbe una involuzione peggiore di radamel #falcao all'arrivo in #premier #chesou #foxcommunity #chelsea^it
if chelsea don't win now - banker mourinho says we should of had a penalty loool falcau dragged his legs on the floor !^en
the commentator - "and mourinho laughs and that's part of the theatre of course."
no one actually takes mourinho seriously! #chesou^en
falcao dived and got a yellow card
#chesou^en
it's not a penalty for you, it's a penalty for us. chelsea fans fck logic^en
the goalkeeper (contact) is well short of where the player over kicked the ball sideways. player continues forward into keeper. no pen #cfc^en
refs are terrible #cfc fans^en
@drecordero so chelsea need to play a 433?^en
ちょっち飛ぶの早かった、粘ってれば普通に倒されてpk貰えたんじゃないの #chesou #epl^ja
there was a dive there from falcao …      #cfc #chesou #bpl #chelsea #premierleague^en
cesc fabregas used to be quite a useful shadow striker in barca. playing that role spoilt his entire positional sense as a central mid. #cfc^en
chelsea are really struggling !!!^en
chelsea fake shit^en
@petecooper100 come on you #saintsfc !!^en
either, 1- robert #madley is having a bad day refereeing; or 2- robert madley is a bad referee. #cfc #shfc #chelsea #southampton^en
this ref is fucking chelsea right now^en
big call, correct call. dive by falcao, already going down before the keeper touched him #chesou^en
chelsea pedindo pra tomar gol^pt
el chelsea juega de todo menos a pasársela al nueve a falcao... así muy duro retomar el nivel^es
that's a difficult call but honestly calm down #cfc supporters. i didn't see a clear penalty^en
stekelenburg didn't throw his hands in front of falcao #wemarchon #chesou^en
@footyaccums he can't give that when he didn't get give the real penalty calls easier #saintsfc^en
chelsea will win this, that is a cast iron certainty. moves then up to liverpool on points.^en
i'm loving the decline of chelsea^en
det er frustrerende at være chelsea-fan i denne sæson... #aegtefans #cfc^da
@documentone go southampton!^en
yg lawan chelsea skrang udah parkir bus aja -_-^in
fucking cheat no wonder we got rid !!! him and costa go well together !! #chelsea^en
yellow card for falcao, yellow card for diving. #cfc^en
chelsea are turning into liverpool^en
penalt fc #chesou^in
@biolakazeem chelsea is turn to apere ajase but let wait for man u 2moro^en
amarilla para @falcao en una acción difícil. el punta colombiano gana la posición pero no es derribado por stekelenburg #chesou #epl^es
falcao has fitted in perfectly at chelsea by being a diving, cynical shithouse.^en
seeing the way #saintsfc play vs #cfc, i realize how much work #lvg has done at #mufc. #mufc is dominating every opponent they played.^en
southampton are just nice to watch, probably cos it's a team in red and white who aren't shit^en
that isn't a penalty. #chesou^en
the ref in this chelsea southhampton game sucks for both teams.^en
that mou's reaction though. the same referee denied southampton real penalty^en
just seen southampton's goal. what a beautiful move^en
wat een heerlijke wedstrijd zeg #chesou^nl
ooh "au moins les joueurs de chelsea ont de vrai bon fans c'est pas comme a l'emirates" mddrr #chesou^fr
chelsea 😂😂😂👎^en
i thought chelsea fans have realised that falcao is only a motivated prince tagoe. sad to say this tbh :'(^en
chelsea's willian has now scored four direct free kicks in four matches. (maccabi tel aviv, newcastle, porto, southampton)^en
doesn't even matter who is at the back... terry, zouma, cahill the goals are pumping in left right and center #cfc^en
good job southampton didn't play like this against us.^en
@southamptonfc work-rate and passion from southampton team is amazing!^en
chelsea will lose this match^en
#saintsfc v. #cfc:no penalty and a yellow for diving for @falcao = awesome.  #bpl #epl #premierleague  #chesou^en
por fin una ivanovic , por fin !! #cfc #cfclat^es
refs got that right. falcao had 'started' the simulation b4 the contact. #chesou #cfcvsfc #snf^en
mou sliding on that sit like chelsea are sliding in the epl table lol^en
#cfclive you need to be a man with the heart of lion to support chelsea,we're tried of mourinho @chelseafc^en
double whammy make up call. we're even, southampton. #cfc #bplonnbc^en
this referee won't have an easy day tomorrow, probably worst performance i've seen in a long time #chesou^en
@amirifwat chelsea punya game eh?^tl
chelsea chaque match ils encaissent un but 😭^fr
we're going to end up having bought half of southampton's squad and somehow not managed to get schneiderlin, ward-prowse, or vvd.^en
falcao has rolled on the grass more times than he has touched the ball in his chelsea career^en
tak penalty lah cibai. aduh kalau mike dean ada, mesti chelsea dapat penalty. #cfclive^in
