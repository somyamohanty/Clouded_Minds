this season than #cfc (17). jose

i will be surprised if mourinho is here at xmas. i feel sorry for him. sure it is in part his fault. but these players should be good #cfc^en
chelsea nak kalah, fnatic nak kalah. malas la jawab paper elc esok.^in
تشلسي هذا الموسم لحد الآن:
دفاع جدا سيء
وسط بطيء
هجوم ضايع
فريق لايخلق فرص
أهداف عشوائية 
النتيجه مع الحظ المركز ١٦ بالدوري
#chelsea^ar
chelsea, la juve, l'om font un très mauvais début de saison mais ça ne leur empêchera pas de finir dans le top au final ;)^fr
i'm not even going to laugh at chelsea just cuz my team also lost stupidly today.^en
