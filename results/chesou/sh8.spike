it makes me sick to my stomach that all these teams have gotten results against chelsea and we couldn't get nothing. not a damn thing^en
so moyes was better in title defending than jose. #sirmoyes #chesou^en
chelsea noob 👎^en
#mourinhoout @awizzy_: in chelsea's mind now, this southampton team na bayern munich"^en
mourinho's chelsea continuously reminds me of david moyes' team at man united. team looks utterly clueless. #fromchampionstoshit^en
whatever befell #chelsea!! the 'special' one is merely a #sangoma, and he has run out of charms... #inwengerwetrust... atleast.^en
when was the last time #chelsea went on relegation?^en
@citi973 chelsea behaving like heartsofoak^en

#تشيلسي #cfc^ar
i still can't believe that refree didn't give #cfc the penalty that #falcoa deserved but it is not the only reason they lost today^en
#cfc reminder: chelsea is number 16 on the log👄👄👄👅👅👅⚽⚽⚽^en

chelsea will only get better once hazard returns from injury. or suspension. or holiday.^en

una derrota más para chelsea. más allá del resultado, preocupa el bajo nivel individual y además el pobre funcionamiento colectivo.sin ideas^es
mourinho, falta pouco para ir de vela do chelsea^pt
chelsea est porté disparu^ro
chelsea at the commanding position in the league. 16th^en
nothing ever goes right for anyone that attacks arsene wenger. #mourinho #chelsea^en
@wisemensaypod looking on the bright side 
your one point nearer chelsea,^en
maybe chelsea need to call harry redknapp^en
chelsea are being outplayed and out thought in every game. jose has lost the dressing room. pack your bags 'special one' you're done!^en

@robertmarawa the is some thing wrong about chelsea ngeke^en
the bridge is empty that fast and that's a good sign #cfc^en
us arsenal fans are close to rioting with our performances, chelsea fans just having banter singing we're fucking shit.^en
last time i remember cfc being so helpless was a loss against charlton. i wasn't at an an alcohol drinking age. found the solution^en
just hear a chelsea fan reassuring his son that we'll stay up this season. is that really what it's come to?^en
lmao chelsea^en
i'm sure chelsea will do fine in the championship next year.^en

fabregas: penting bagi chelsea untuk tak kalah: cesc fabregas mengakui chelsea tak boleh terus kalah… #selancarbola^in
on the other hand, i can't lie - i am kinda feeling good when mou loses and blames everyone else but himself. #cfc^en
i don't think the gods have forgiven mourinho for firing his doctors. chelsea's form has been on a downward spiral ever since the debacle. 😂^en
@southamptonfc  what a win! #wemarchon #saintsfc^en
masih tetap!!!! #cfc^in
seeing as #lfc can't seem to sort out their managerial situation watch klopp or ancelotti end up at chelsea.^en
nossa sequência: everton (a), tottenham (a), rubin kazan (h), southampton (h), bournemouth (h), chelsea (a), rubin kazan (a), palace (a)^sk

stamford bridge doesn't love mourinho anymore. i can now bet on chelsea losing at home.^en
y'all #cfc dudes should chill, mourinho must give us our 3points too before he wakes up from this sleep
#mufc^en
chelsea's bonanza still valid till next year.^en
