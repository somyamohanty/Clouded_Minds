southampton supposed to have two penalties already^en
two direct penalties for southampton. william moves his fk yards ahead for a better angle. no reason chelsea to have a 12th man every week^en
tries to dive again, outside this time. get a yellow for diving. the football gods are on our side once more. #cfc^en
#cfclive chelsea r lucky^en
ref is a disgrace, obviously nonced a 12 year old chelsea fan and told him he'll make chelsea win if he keeps quiet^en
chelsea bought the ref on this one^en
