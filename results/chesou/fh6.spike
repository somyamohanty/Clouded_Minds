21' chelsea chega e fonte corta de carrinho^pt
willian chelsea'yi sırtlamaya devam ediyor^tr
what a feeling to see roman on tv, he is nervous like a hell #cfc^en
how has the keeper not saved that? #saintsfc^en
yo aguanto muchas cosas, pero un partido de chelsea comentado por marocco, no. es como algo que tiene sida y cáncer al mismo tiempo.^es
that lay off for falcao is just typical.. what a load of fucking crap. #cfc^en
oscar moi j'ai jamz compris ce joueur 😞😞😞 #chesou^fr
good to see jt back in the starting 11 today...captain, leader, legend 🙌💙 #cfc^en
he's done it again. another free kick and another goal. willian you beauty #cfc #theblues^en
at dads so missing the chelsea game again^en
watching mata play well and de bruyne looking sweet, makes it hurt that much more to see oscar. so unimpressive #cfc^en
free kick willian superb! #cfc^en
chelsea have no rhythm to their play. what is the philosophy^en
que equipaso tiene chelsea culia^es
much better this from chelsea, been a good start. bit shaky at the back at times, but good to see us take an early lead.^en
@joeodwyer__ he's overseen a lot of world class wingers at chelsea hasn't he.  they're different players though^en
come on #chelsea !!!!!^en
we need more goals. #cfc^en
willian 4th free kick goal in a row: maccabi, newcastle, porto &amp; now southampton. ronaldo who?^en
i hope chelsea loses today because it would just be too funny^en
if chelsea win this i win a cheeky £40 😘👍🏼^en
@alizombie_ hey, we're from southampton! but yea that was filmed in winch^en
it's reached a point where once chelsea get a freekick on the left you kindly request to restart to save on time looking for an equalizer^en
qué mal está jugando el chelsea, y hazard, un paquete.^es
stekelenburg seemed to have time to reset himself more than once but completely flummoxed by movement on ball from willian free kick #chesou^en
#cfc @skysports   cmon chaps. the whole of the ball has to cross the whole of the line to be out of play.  happy to draw a diagram^en
few coronas and the chelsea game 🍻^en
dulu algojo freekick chelsea : lampard drogba luiz mata ballack sekarang : willian oscar #future #ktbffh^in
@cesarmorenoh imposible. chelsea solo ha pasado dos veces de medio campo^es
when the lfc transfer committee scouted southampton centre backs, did they not notice fonte over lovren or did they mix them up?^en
this chelsea reminds me of tha chelsea from 13/14 season where we hoped hazard to do all the attacking phase!^en
remember when chelsea fans swore hazard was better than msn?^en
@andrescantorgol hoy golea el chelsea al southampton xk hoy si tocan todos y cuando anda diego costas no pasa el balon saludos a liberal ks^es

01シーズンならもうラニエリかな？
#cfc^ja
southampton's crest looks like it was designed by a sunday school teacher on s flannelgraph.^en
stamford bridge is eerily quiet at times. tension when southampton have the ball, though they''re too ponderous to make it count #cfc^en

five of chelsea's 21 goals this season (all comps) have come from direct free-kicks.^en
well for a change chelsea are leading 1-0 :d i hope the saints score some goals . chelsea is very beatable . #chesou^en
willian, you beauty! your freekicks should not be free to watch. absolutely not. no.
#chesou @willianborges88^en
@dannykellywords insinuation that he’s been bribed is unpleasant and unworthy. and i fucking hate chelsea.^en

uni 0    hawkeyes 0 [top 4th] [0 out] [0 balls] [0 strikes] ... no one on [p: #6 erin riding] [b: #26 chelsea ross]^en
terry is in the starting xi to defend the areal treat of pele southampton is rearranging the lineup by moving mane up front sometimes^en
partido peleado en el medio... hasta ahora el gol es de otro partido #saintsfc^es
southampton can't lose this game..they just can't. it's so important they nick the 3 points^en

apoyando al chelsea con tal que haga gol falcao ¡vamos tigre!^es

@skybet hi why don't i have the cash out option on the chelsea game ? all my bets today have been ruined by this bet tracker , refund me ?^en
chelsea players should make a point of falling in area where willian has taken those four direct kick goals. maybe they already are. #fpl^en
¿pero y el tremendo golazo de falta que ha marcado el chelsea? no puedo dejar de verlo, ni en el fifa te sale tan bien el tiro. brutal.^es

we're playing absolutely dreadful football. this is even worse than liverpool. no chances for chelsea bar a lucky goal^en
20 minutes gone and its 1-0 to chelsea, hazard certainty looks up for it today. #cfc^en
hazard shows good strength to receive the ball for #cfc and turn but his pass his cut off but #saintsfc^en
