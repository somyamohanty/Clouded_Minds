southampton the better team,playing better than chelsea,should have been awarded a penalty yet they are trailing.#chesou^en
i think chelsea got some tired legs out^en
even if we sack sherwood we would most likely, have no manager going into the chelsea game #avfc^en
begovic has to be alert to palm mane's cross behind. he claims the resulting corner, too.40mins' chelsea 1 - 0 southampton^en

@stevenarce increible el chelsea con hazard, oscar y fabregas no realicen una una jugada con elaboracion, solo pelotazos y velocidad.^es
de verdad que el chelsea juega mal, muy mal.^es
#cfc  midfield is flat . falcao not getting the balls. fabregas is anonymous . generally average aside willian  freekick^en

@brila889fm pls sugar man , mind how you criticise arsenal and its coach , chelsea will this match . #onitsha^en
chelsea fans not sure who to aim their anger at so now just booing every black southampton-player^en
